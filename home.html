        <h1> Xavier's Core Curriculum </h1>
        <p1> Xavier University of Louisiana’s Core Curriculum (XCore) emphasizes Xavier’s identity as a Catholic and historically Black institution and supports the goal that students should achieve both breadth and depth of knowledge in the liberal arts. XCore enriches the undergraduate educational experience by exposing students to integrative approaches in learning and by cultivating nuanced perspectives for engaging in thought and in action the major questions of their lives. Required of all undergraduate students in the College of Arts and Sciences, the 40 credit hours of the XCore provide the foundation and, together with the major program of study, contribute to a well-rounded education. </p1>
